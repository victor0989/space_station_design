Internal Air Pressurization. The lunar structure will have to be a
 life-supporting, closed environment consisting of a volume with an internal pres
sure of 6.9 × 104 to 10.3 × 104 Pa. The enclosure structure must contain this
 pressure, and must be designed to be “fail-safe” against catastrophic and other
 decompression caused by accidental and natural impacts. Internal pressurization
 offers challenges to all lunar structures, but especially the inflatable concept.
 Placing inflatables inside lava tubes or under large concrete arch structures would
 eliminate many associated risks.
