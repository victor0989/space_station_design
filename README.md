# space_station_design
Brief, artificial content, key resources for aerospace design theory and software creation.
Space station design involves aerospace engineering theory and specialized software. Key aspects include:

1)Structural Engineering: Ensuring the station can withstand space conditions.
2)Simulation Software: Creating detailed 3D models and predicting potential issues.
3)Life Support Systems: Managing air, water, and food for long-term survival.
4)Radiation Protection: Developing materials to protect astronauts from cosmic radiation.
